Description of the Solution:
    Applying the ensemble of augmentations and using that as an metric for generalization.
    We are checking whether the model's output changes after augmenting the image. A penalty is added if the model's output changes once the image is augmented.
    The reason being that for humans are able to identify even after the object in the image even after the image is rotated/saturated.
Motivation:
    CNN Models are texture biased and [1] shows the some augmentations are really increasing the texture model of the model.
